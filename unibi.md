**Bielefeld University** is a public
university in [Bielefeld](Bielefeld "wikilink"), Germany. Founded in
1969, it is one of the country\'s newer universities, and considers
itself a \"reform\" university, following a different style of
organization and teaching than the established universities. In
particular, the university aims to \"re-establish the unity between
research and teaching\", and so all its faculty teach courses in their
area of research. The university also stresses a focus on
interdisciplinary research, helped by the architecture, which encloses
all faculties in one great structure. It is among the first of the
German universities to switch some faculties (e.g. biology) to
[Bachelor](Bachelor's_degree "wikilink")/[Master](Master's_degree "wikilink")-degrees
as part of the [Bologna process](Bologna_process "wikilink").

Bielefeld University has started an extensive multi-phase modernisation
project, which is to be completed by 2025. A total investment of more
than 1 billion euros has been planned for this undertaking.[^1]

## Campus

The university is located in the west of Bielefeld next to the
[Teutoburg Forest](Teutoburg_Forest "wikilink"). The main building,
which houses all the faculties and institutes, as well as the large
library, is a functional concrete structure, typical of the 1960s. The
main building with 154,000 m^2^ alone is one of the largest structures
in Europe.[^2]

Intercity trains running between
[Cologne](Cologne "wikilink")/[Bonn](Bonn "wikilink") and
[Berlin](Berlin "wikilink") stop regularly at Bielefeld, and the
university can be accessed via city tram (Line 4) in about 10 minutes
from the city center---or in about 15 minutes by car. The nearest
airport, [Paderborn/Lippstadt](Paderborn_Lippstadt_Airport "wikilink"),
is about 50 kilometres southeast of Bielefeld.[^3]

### Library

Bielefeld University Library occupies most of the first floor of the
main university building and contains over 2.2 million volumes. It is
open every day of the year, from 08:00 until 01:00 Monday to Friday, and
from 09:00 to 22:00 during weekends and public holidays.[^4]

The library\'s projects include the development of tools to improve
access to electronic resources. It works with commercial system
suppliers to meet the needs of academic libraries---collaborations that
have resulted in developments such as
[BASE](BASE_(search_engine) "wikilink") (Bielefeld Academic Search
Engine), by which [metadata](metadata "wikilink") is collected from
scientific repository [servers](Server_(computing) "wikilink") and
indexed, along with data from selected web sites and data collections,
using the [Solr](Apache_Solr "wikilink") framework.[^5]

### Oberstufen-Kolleg at the University of Bielefeld {#oberstufen_kolleg_at_the_university_of_bielefeld}

The Oberstufen-Kolleg is a [UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink") Project School
and as such it aims for international understanding and cooperation.
Since 1998, the Kolleg has worked together with the [German School of
Guayaquil](German_School_of_Guayaquil "wikilink") in a charitable
project to help in the development of the town of Daular, Ecuador,[^6]
which project won a United Nations Award in 2006/2007 for its
international concept.[^7]

```
In the [QS World University
Rankings](QS_World_University_Rankings "wikilink") for 2024, the
university is placed within the 951--1000 range, ranking as the 45th
institution at the national level.[^8] In contrast, the university
achieves a higher position in the [Times Higher Education World
University
Rankings](Times_Higher_Education_World_University_Rankings "wikilink"),
where it lands within the 201--250 bracket in 2023, and ranks between
23rd and 26th in the country.[^9] According to the [Academic Ranking of
World Universities](Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities "wikilink")
for 2023, the university\'s global rank falls within the 701--800 range,
placing it between 41st and 42nd nationally.[^10]

In 2017, Bielefeld University was ranked 22nd in the world by the Times
Higher Education (THE) Young University Rankings,[^11] and among the top
300 universities by the traditional [Times Higher Education World
University
Rankings](Times_Higher_Education_World_University_Rankings "wikilink").

In the THE ranking of 2011 Bielefeld is placed among the top 50
universities in engineering and technology.[^12]

In terms of mathematics, the [Academic Ranking of World
Universities](Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities "wikilink") of 2018
[^13] places Bielefeld among the four best universities of Germany and
101--150 best universities in the world. The German Center for Higher
Education Development Excellence Ranking, which measures academic
performance of European graduate programs in biology, chemistry,
mathematics, and physics, placed Bielefeld in the excellence group for
mathematics.`{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}`{=mediawiki}

## Protests against tuition fees {#protests_against_tuition_fees}

Bielefeld University was one of the centers of student protests in the
fight against the introduction of [tuition
fees](tuition_fees "wikilink"). In the course of the protests, the
central hall and the university president\'s office were occupied by
protesting students for over a month. In a vote organised by the
[AStA](AStA "wikilink") and the students parliament, about 94 percent of
the participants voted against the introduction of tuition fees,
although only 22 percent of the students cast their vote. This is
comparable to similar results at other German universities.

In its session of 12 July 2006, the university senate decided to
introduce tuition fees of €500 per semester, beginning in
2007.[^14][^15]

In August 2006, a universal key for the university went missing during a
senate session. After that, multiple cases of arson and
[defacement](Defacement_(vandalism) "wikilink") of university property
were reported. University president Dieter Timmermann was a particular
target of these attacks. The cost of the damage, mainly due to the
replacement of thousands of locks, was estimated at over a million
euros.
